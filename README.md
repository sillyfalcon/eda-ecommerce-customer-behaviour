Check out the Jupyter notebook here: https://jovian.ai/anushree-k/zerotoanalyst-ecomm-eda

Exploratory analysis and predictive analysis techniques help businesses to structure and recalibrate their pricing, marketing, inventory stragies and more in real-time.
B2C e-commerce businesses generate voluminous amounts of data. 

In this notebook we will perform the exploratory data analysis for a multicategory e-commerce store using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Identify a dataset for analysis
- Explore techniques to work with large data sets
- Pre-process or prepare the data for analysis
- Transform the data into various summary views

Let us call this anonymised dataset Shrinkme. We will use our framework to ask and answer interesting questions, create visualisations for the following areas of interest:

- Pattern of visits by day , day of week or hour of day
- View and purchase patterns for products and categories
- Popular brands and their contribution to monthly sales
- Segment customers using RFM

<b>About the data</b>  
In this analysis we will use the "eCommerce behavior data from multi category store" data by Michael Kechinov on Kaggle from the REES46 Marketing Platform.

The Kaggle dataset has two .csv files
- 2019-Nov.csv 8.4 GB and 67.5 million records  
- 2019-Oct.csv 5.3GB and 42.4 million records  

We will build the framework with and perform the analysis on the 2019-Oct.csv file.
